# My Portfolio Page for Earth Data Analytics

Welcome to my site! I am a first year PhD student at University of Colorado Boulder. I am broadly interested in investigating questions about vegetation community response to climate change and modeling future shifts in these communities. In addition, I am interested in compounding factors including legacy disturbances and biotic interactions. 

## Project #1

Here, I graphed changes in temperature anomalies over time in Hilo, Hawaii USA.
